Currently I'm working on ticket WW-2 which is just the creation of the home page. In reality I'm just refreshing and improving 
my knowledge of React, Javascript, CSS and HTML. Today I spent my time figuring out how to use flexboxes so I could have a profile
photo next to my bio only to realise that if I want my website to look proffesional then I want to have a hero section so 
creating that will be my next task. Nevertheless I started to gain a better understanding of
the 'react-native' and 'styled-components' libraries and today I'll push the code up to git for the first time since
the react app was initialised. I'll attach a photo for what the website currently looks like. For now I will be writing the
log entries here on a txt file in the hope that I can write some code that will parse these entries into a more presentable format
for the website and then maybe create the functionality within the website to write log entries and have them stored on a database.

I've made my hero section using styled-components. It's mainly taken from an article: https://medium.com/@ryaddev/creating-a-stunning-hero-section-in-react-with-styled-components-e84d060f6cdc
but I've made changes and will continue to make changes to it. I've left the previous home page still underneath the hero section. I'll
add a new photo here with the decsription that I want to add to the home page. Forgive the silly photo that comes with the log here. I'm happy with 
the basics. The home page just needs more styling, the download CV button must work and then I just need to finish the text on and its done.

The website Home Page is really taking shape. I've primarily been focussed on styling and making the website look
appealing. The Hero Section photo has changed and instead of a single profile photo with one long paragraph of
text I've added multiple photos and enlarged the text to give brief descriptions of the stages of my life. This is after looking
at other good examples of personal websites. I've also been using the google fonts library to imprive the text and I created my own Favicon/Logo here:
